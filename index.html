         Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj
        Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of
        the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in
        1612.<center><button><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">more info</a></button></center>

        Qutub Minar is the pride of Delhi. The tall minaret was constructed in 1192 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak, and later completed
        by his successor Iltutmish. The soaring conical tower is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic Afghan architecture.
        
        Qutub Minar is a World Heritage Site and has survived the ravages of time impressively.<center><button><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_Minar">more info</a></button></center>

        The Lotus Temple derives its name from its design. Like every other Bahāʾī mashriq, it is characterized by a nine-sided
        construction, in keeping with the Bahāʾī belief in the mystical properties of the number nine. Set on an elevated plinth
        in a 26-acre (10.5-hectare) expanse of landscaped gardens and surrounded by nine pools bordered by red sandstone.

    complex of 27.04 ha. that includes other contemporary, 16th century Mughal garden-tombs such as Nila Gumbad, Isa Khan.
